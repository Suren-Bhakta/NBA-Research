# NBA-Research
This repository showcases the ongoing research I have done for the NBA starting in Microsoft Excel and then moving into RStudio.

The first portion of this project focused on proving the existence of a "prime" in the NBA. The term prime is associated with the peak in one's playing career. For this, a hypothesis of a prime being statistically visible was tested. First, a random sample of 75 players was extracted from www.basketballreference.com. Then, I manually retrieved the points per game for each player which required an extensive amount of data cleaning. Following this, each player was grouped into a specific age range to perform simple descriptive statistics. Finally, a single factor ANOVA test was performed assuming unequal variance to see if there was a distinct difference in the age ranges and if so, was the presumed age group display the best performance?

The second project, was an expansion of the previous, now wanting to see if certain factors contributed to that player's individual win percentage. The factors chosen were Age and Usage Rate. Individual player stats were gathered from www.statmuse.com and complete analyses were done using the statistical software RStudio.
