# NBA-Research
This repository showcases the ongoing research I have done for the NBA starting in Microsoft Excel and then moving into Rstudio.

The first portion of this project focused on proving the existence of a "prime" in the NBA. The term prime is associated with the peak in one's playing career. For this, a hypothesis of a prime being statistically visible was tested. First, a random sample of 75 players was extracted from www.basketballreference.com. Then, I manually retrieved the points per game for each player which required an extensive amount of data cleaning. Following this, each player was grouped into a specific age range to perform simple descriptive statistics. Finally, a single factor ANOVA test was performed assuming unequal variance to see if there was a distinct difference in the age ranges and if so, was the presumed age group the best performing?
